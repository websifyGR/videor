## About VideoR project - [https://videor.pro](https://videor.pro)

Working on **Youtube IFrame Player API** using **Bootstrap**, vanilla **Javascript** and special techniques to provide subscription type services base on video.

These services may involve watching **video on demand**, hosted by YouTube or other streaming providers, for the purpose of **education**, **entertainment** and **information**.

The final configuration will require us to design a database of our choice and develop the code on the server, with whatever programming language we prefer.

> Therefore, the purpose of *this script* is to deal with the part of the code that deals with the **end user interface**
